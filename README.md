Hi, I am Jonathan Omhans Okhunhun.
I am currentely taking a course in Data Analysis which inclide; Ms Excel, SQL, and PowerBi.
This project was undertaken as a part of the requirements for certification in Foundation of Reporting with Micro Soft Excel.
It is one task amongst many others that I have undertaken to Show that I have a good foundational knowledge in Data Analysis.
This is not going to be the last project I’ll undertake as I strive to actualize my dream of becoming a certified professional in Data Analysis.
I’ll engage in continuous learning as well as seize every opportunity to collaborate and explore new opportunities.
Constructive criticism of the project, meaningful contribution, and sincere commendation are welcome.
